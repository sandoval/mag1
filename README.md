## Introduction
Project that explores different methods of integral numeric calculations.


## The 10+ Commandments (for good development)
  1. Before starting coding, read those rules to avoid problems
  2. Verify your .gitignore to exclude inconvenient files
  3. Always pull before starting coding and before pushing any code
  4. Always commit working and well tested code
  5. Always commit with an expressive message attached
      (Eg:. [Daniel] Readme updated! Rules section added!)
  6. **Always write code, commit messages and documentation in English (i18n comes later)**
  7. Refactor always as possible
  8. Don't delete someone else's code, comment instead
  9. Report your changes in this document on our Facebook Group
  10. Add more rules if you consider that are something important missing
